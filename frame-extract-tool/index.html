            <h6>from <a href="https://ghosh.dev">ghosh.dev</a></h6>
            <p>
                Upload a video to extract frames from it. Extracted frames are downloaded automatically as a ZIP file
                with each frame stored as a JPEG image (85% quality).
            </p>
            <p>
                This does not upload the video to any server. All processing is done locally on your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process is simple: an uploaded video is taken and passed on to a hidden HTML
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video" target="_blank">video</a>
                element that can play it. Based on number of frames to be extracted, the video is paused at each
                suitable interval and then its pixels are rendered on a hidden HTML
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas" target="_blank">canvas</a>
                element to extract out the image bitmap data for the paused frame. This means the so called frames are
                an outcome of interpolation and video playback and not truly "frame accurate" from a purist's
                perspective. However, this still works out fairly well for the human eye. Each such extracted frame is
                then converted into a
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob" target="_blank">blob</a> and all of that
                is eventually zipped together and downloaded for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                For seeing a similar mechanism in action which first extracts out some frames from a video using the
                same mechanism and then uses scroll input to scrub and animate through them, check out the
                <a href="../video-seek-unpack-frames-canvas">video-seek-unpack-frames-canvas</a> demo.

                Most of this code is written for modern browsers and so far only tested on newer versions of Chrome
                (v78+). I haven't (yet) got the time to test it across all browsers and provide the suitable polyfills
                where required; my apologies if it breaks on an older or different browser :(
