                Attempts &amp; Demos
            </h3>

            <h4>
                <a href="/video-current-time">#1: video-current-time</a>
            </h4>
            <p>
                This mechanism simply loads the video in a HTML5 <code>video</code> tag and attempts to set the
                <code>currentTime</code>
                property of the loaded video in an attempt to scrub it when scrolling.
            </p>
            <p>
                This somewhat works out on high end devices especially with low quality videos. But can’t be trusted,
                atleast definitely not on mobile browsers. Rule of thumb, the browser does a lot of intelligent things
                to adjust the how and when of video seeking and painting the corresponding frame. This is probably the
                most naive (and stupidest) way.
            </p>

            <h4>
                <a href="/video-play-unpack-frames-canvas">#2: video-play-unpack-frames-canvas</a>
            </h4>
            <p>
                This mechanism simply downloads the video in an HTML5 <code>video</code> tag, and unpacks video frames
                from it by starting to <code>play</code> the video and then listening to regular
                <code>timeupdate</code> event on the video element to be fired, at which point it
                <code>pauses</code> the video to grab a frame by painting the outcome on an
                <code>OffscreenCanvas</code> element and collecting the frame’s image bitmap from canvas’ 2D context.
                When done, it <code>plays</code> the video again, and the loop continues till the video has been played
                to the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine this to be generating a set of image files from the original source video we we do this
                generation in the browser directly using an <code>OffscreenCanvas</code>. We could do this with a normal
                <code>canvas</code>
                element as well, but not a great reason to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once that is done, for scrubbing, we figure out the correct frame to paint based on the input signal
                (scroll position in this example) and then draw the correct frame on a <em>visible</em>
                <code>canvas</code> element’s 2D context on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not as elegant as we may initially think. Of course, the time to extract out the frames is
                lower-bound by the duration of the video but overall it takes much more time due to so much amount of
                javascript work happening.
            </p>

            <h4>
                <a href="/video-seek-unpack-frames-canvas">#3: video-seek-unpack-frames-canvas</a>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Very similar to <code>video-play-unpack-frames-canvas</code>, this also downloads the video in an HTML5
                <code>video</code>
                tag, but unpacks video frames from it by <em>seeking</em> through the video at regular intervals and
                painting the outcome on a <code>OffscreenCanvas</code> element and collecting the frame’s image bitmap
                from canvas’ 2D context. A predefined number of frames are unpacked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once that is done, for scrubbing, we figure out the correct frame to paint based on the input signal
                (scroll position in this example) and then draw the correct frame on a <em>visible</em>
                <code>canvas</code> element’s 2D context on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, it brings some improvements over <code>video-play-unpack-frames-canvas</code> - much faster due to
                seek rather than play (not being bound to video <code>duration</code>), and with a bit more control on
                the number of frames and perhaps hopefully cheaper in comparison.
            </p>

                <a href="/video-seek-media-stream-image-capture">#4: video-seek-media-stream-image-capture</a>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Largely similar to above approach of <code>video-seek-unpack-frames-canvas</code> in terms of seeking
                through the video using a HTML5 <code>video</code> tag, but instead of pausing and drawing it on a
                canvas context to extract out the frame’s image bitmap data, we use
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/captureStream"
                    ><code>captureStream()</code></a
                >
                on the <code>video</code> element to capture the video stream and then we use the captured stream’s
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageCapture"><code>ImageCapture</code></a>
                interface to grab the image bitmap data of a frame at a desired point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once that is done, for scrubbing, we follow the exact same approach as above.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this approach originally seemed relatively a bit elegant conceptually, to use the MediaStream
                APIs, in reality this turned out to be way slower performance wise, often taking as much as more than
                double the time in extracting a frame compared to directly drawing the video element in a Offscreen
                canvas’ 2D context and extracting out the image bitmap from it :(

            <h4>
                <a href="/video-server-frames">#5: video-server-frames</a>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Perhaps the simplest mechanism of all, which relies on the server to provide a bunch of video frames as
                images to scrub through. This works out well when you know what video would be scrubbed through exactly
                (a common use-case for such a scroll based video scrub animation) and the server can handle the frames
                extraction and serving part, freeing up the client from having to download a video and perform all the
                prep up work and computation to extract frames out of it. On a decent network connection, this turns out
                to be the fastest mechanism to bootstrap the scrubbing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a production environment that fits such use-cases, this is perhaps the best way to go about it for
                now with much complexity removed from the client. As a bonus, this opens up pathways for things like
                image quality, how many frames would be downloaded and all that which can be more easily negotiated with
                the server based on information on client-side capabilities (device computation power, memory, network
                speed, data-saver modes and so on) as compared to having to download a video and then extract pieces
                from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, it seemed that downloading an image sprite with a bunch of frames as opposed to individual
                requests for frames maybe a good idea, but it turned out tricky. Based on the actual frame images and
                things like how many frames, sprites can actually degrade the performance (size of downloads). In a
                world with HTTP/2, distinct images seem to usually fare better. We can even prioritise frame download
                and bootstrap the scrubbing experience faster if we want.
            </p>

            <h4><a href="#">#6: video-wasm-ffmpeg-extract</a> (no demo yet)</h4>
            <p>
                Definitely an idea to pursue, although I haven’t yet been able to test this in action.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea is to exploit <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> to have
                an in-browser ffmpeg module loaded which can then be invoked to extract out frames.
            </p>
            <p>
                This should be possible today in theory with
                <a href="https://github.com/Kagami/ffmpeg.js">ffmpeg.js</a>. I tried going through this but have so far
                given up having faced a number of difficulties with compiling low-level modules into a build of
                ffmpeg.js that would work for this experiment - somehow, the default ffpmeg.js builds are not built with
                the required options needed for performing frame extracts. I’ll try again in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                One sureshot thing to consider though - for typical small sized videos or when the actual video in
                question is known not to change, this sounds like a fairly over-engineered idea. The WASM library build
                for ffmpeg.js itself is humongous in size for one (~14MB) to have it downloaded and instantiated before
                any actual work can happen, which is fairly cost prohibitive for what I had been trying to achieve here.
                This would however probably break-even for other use-cases which may fit the bill better - say we’re
                dynamically changing a lot of video content, scrubbing through them, saving them back and so on (eg. a
                in-browser video frame extractor and editor).

                While playing around with these experiments, I decided to quickly hack up together a
                <strong>video frame extract tool</strong> that can take any video that is uploaded and extract out
                frames from it which which can be conveniently downloaded as a bunch of JPEG images within a single ZIP
                file.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s also a bit configurable, such as how many frames to extract or at what frame rate.
                <a href="/frame-extract-tool">Try it out!</a>.
